### 11 - Saturday
* Programs like `free(1)` get their stats using procfiles (already knew this) and
  reduce overhead by keeping files open and seeking to the beginning whenever they
  need to reread data.
* HyperDex, the distributed key-value store, uses a deterministic hash to map data
  to n-dimensional space. Data is distributed to multiple servers by partitioning
  this n-dimensional space. The dimensions are chosen by which attributes you're
  indexing (well, it's not really an index, but you get the idea).
* `epoll(7)` has two interfaces: edge-triggered and level-triggered. These things
  are pretty cool, and have different uses.
  I found this explanation to be the most helpful: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9162712/what-is-the-purpose-of-epolls-edge-triggered-option
* The Milky Way has four spiral arms: http://www.sci-news.com/astronomy/science-milky-way-galaxy-four-spiral-arms-01649.html
  We can figure this out by observing everything from a single point -- Earth!
* I realized that I'd rather figure out what I'm doing wrong on my own rather than
  have someone tell me that I'm doing it wrong. This is for nontrivial things.

### 12 - Sunday
* LMDB is an example of a database that doesn't use a write-ahead log. It basically uses
  an append-only B+ tree with only two versions.
* The majority of my classes for this semester are taught by graduate students.
* I can now search the web on Tumblr using Yahoo's search engine which is powered by Bing.
  Why is this useful? I have no idea.

### 13 - Monday
* I learn a lot from the folks on Twitter.

### 14 - Tuesday
* Charlottesville is (getting) pretty hot for data science
* The Oscars and the Academy Awards are the same thing
